# Open Source Project: SafePath

## Project Overview
SafePath is an open-source mobile application designed to provide real-time alerts on imminent physical dangers such as landmines, explosive devices, and active conflict zones. The app is based on a crowdsourcing model where users can report dangers in specific areas. It also integrates data from humanitarian organizations and sensors, such as drones or satellites, to reduce risks for civilians and humanitarian workers by providing useful and timely information for safe navigation in hazardous areas.

## Functional Specifications

### 1. Interactive Hazard Mapping
- Real-time visualization of risk areas (mines, explosive devices, active conflicts).
- Zoom functionality to explore different areas and detail levels (roads, village boundaries, etc.).
- Risk filters: Ability to filter hazards by type (e.g., mines, conflicts, cleared areas).
- Clear visual indicators: Icons for mines, explosives, military checkpoints, etc.

### 2. Collaborative Reporting (Crowdsourcing)
- Users can report hazards through the app interface, adding:
  - Precise GPS location.
  - Type of hazard (selectable from a predefined list).
  - Short description or photo (optional, if connection permits).
- Validation of reports: Users can confirm or dispute existing reports, with a reputation system to make reports more reliable.
- Timed reports: Unconfirmed reports expire after a certain period (configurable).

### 3. Safe Navigation
- The app provides safe routes between two points, avoiding reported danger areas.
- Users receive voice alerts or notifications when approaching a danger zone.
- Offline navigation: Option to download maps and routes for risky areas to use offline.

### 4. Real-Time Alerts and Notifications
- Users receive push notifications in case of new reports or updates on nearby danger zones.
- Ability to configure notifications based on distance from the hazard (e.g., alerts for risks within 5 km).
- **SOS Mode**: A quick button to send an emergency signal with location to pre-set contacts or local emergency services.

### 5. Collaboration with Humanitarian Organizations
- Integration of official information provided by NGOs and demining operators.
- Organizations can upload data on cleared areas or intervention zones through an associated web portal.

### 6. Education and Awareness
- A section dedicated to interactive tutorials and educational materials on how to act in the presence of landmines or explosives.
- Gamified training: Small quizzes or games to educate people, especially children, about the dangers of landmines.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Supported Platforms
- **Android**: Min. version 7.0.
- **iOS**: Min. version 13.0.
- **Web app**: For NGO and administrator data management portal.

### 2. Frontend Technologies
- **Graphical user interface (GUI)**: Built using **GTK** or **Ncurses** for a terminal-based UI.
- **Mapping system**: Custom implementation for map rendering using libraries like **Cairo** (for 2D rendering) or other simple graphical libraries compatible with C.
- **Minimalist UI**: Optimized for usability in emergencies with a simple and clear design, using large buttons and minimal input.

### 3. Backend and Server
- **Backend in C**: Server for managing hazard data and user reports.
- **Database integration**: Use of **SQLite** (lightweight, embedded database) or a custom binary format for low-resource environments.
- **Networking**: Custom server built using **libmicrohttpd** or native sockets for handling incoming reports and distributing updates to clients.
- **Push notifications**: Implemented via a custom protocol for real-time notifications, or via integrations with mobile services for Android/iOS notifications.
- **Offline support**: Automatic data sync when online, local caching of maps and routes and let the app download offline an area of interest.

### 4. Security
- **Data encryption**: Encrypted communications (SSL/TLS) and server-side encryption of sensitive data.
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 for secure user access management (civilians, humanitarian workers).
- **Anonymity**: Ability to report hazards anonymously, to protect user privacy.

### 5. Scalability and Infrastructure
- **Cloud infrastructure**: Use cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud) to ensure scalability and global distribution.
- **Data redundancy**: Regular, distributed backups to ensure data availability even in case of disasters.

## Open Source Project Organization

### 1. GitHub Repository
- **Repository structure**: Separate code into modules (front-end, back-end, documentation).
- **Issue tracking**: Use GitHub Issues to track bugs, new features, and user requests.
- **CI/CD**: Continuous integration with GitHub Actions or Travis CI for automatic testing and deployment.

### 2. Community Collaboration
- **Contributor guidelines**: Clear guidelines for contributors on how to propose changes or new features.
- **Code of conduct**: Define a code of conduct to ensure collaboration in a safe and inclusive environment.
- **Mentoring program**: Initiatives to help new contributors get involved (e.g., mentorship or tagging easy-to-fix issues for beginners).

### 3. Documentation
- **Wiki**: Complete documentation on how to install, configure, and contribute to the project.
- **API documentation**: Detailed documentation for the use of public APIs.
- **User manual**: Guide for end-users on how to use the app's various features.

### 4. License
- The project will be released under the **MIT** license, to ensure maximum freedom of use, modification, and distribution.

## Long-Term Goals
- **Integration with drones and sensors**: Collaborate with research teams to include data collected by drones, radar, and geological sensors.
- **AI-assisted visual recognition**: Develop an artificial intelligence system for automatic recognition of ordnances from photos.
- **Institutional collaborations**: Establish partnerships with governments and international organizations to expand app usage and improve effectiveness.
